### Main API Endpoints

To implement the functionality for working with camper listings in your frontend
application, use the ready-made backend API available at the following link:

```bash
https://66b1f8e71ca8ad33d4f5f63e.mockapi.io/campers
```

The application interacts with a backend API for camper listings, accessible at:

- `GET /campers` – Fetch all camper listings (filtering handled on the backend).
- `GET /campers/:id` – Fetch detailed information for a specific camper by its
  ID.
